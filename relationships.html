          Kaito and Aoko Nakamori have been best friends since they were little and first met at the clock
          tower. They are portrayed as a similar pairing to Shinichi Kudo and Ran Mouri (including how the
          characters are drawn) and Heiji Hattori and Kazuha Toyama, except much sillier. Kaito often teases Aoko by
          flipping her skirt. However, it has been seen that Kaito is quite protective of Aoko and doesn't appear to
          want her to go on a date with Saguru Hakuba. Aoko was somewhat suspicious that Kaito was Kaitou Kid, and
          in order to prove his innocence, she brought him along to a movie when a heist had been scheduled. She
          handcuffed him to the seat, but Kaito managed to escape and pull off the heist, thus veering Aoko's
          suspicions away from him. The two have feelings for one each other, but neither has admitted it as of yet.

            In the last chapter of Yaiba a scene set after a three years time skip has Keiko Momoi telling Sayaka
            Mine
            that Kuroba and Nakamori are a couple now, while Keiko's friend confirms having seen them together.

          Since Akako's first appearance in Volume 1, she's attempted to get Kaito to fall head over heels for her
          using whatever means necessary, including using a voodoo doll and hurting him in the process. Akako's
          obsession with Kaito comes from Kaitou Kid, whom she realizes is Kaito, being the only man on Earth able
          to resist her. Despite Akako injuring Kaito during their first confrontation, Kaito as Kid behaves like
          a
          complete gentleman and encourages Akako to be herself in order to get someone to like her instead of
          forcing them through witchcraft. Akako grows to have great concern for Kaito as evidenced by her
          warning Kaito against going to a heist and later assisting Kaitou Kid to escape safely from the heist
          that she had foreseen him being captured at. In Volume 2, Akako openly states she likes Kaito in front
          of Aoko.

          The relationship between Hakuba and Kaito is a rather tense one; since Saguru convinced himself early
          on
          that Kaito was instead Kid, and during the first few volumes he's constantly throwing out offhand
          comments
          that show his suspicion. However, later on in the manga, we have a small scene where Saguru calls
          Kaito
          from Paris in order to give him some information on 'Chat Noir', a dangerous, fellow gem thief trying
          to
          outshine Kid. Though Kaito continues to vehemently deny being Kid, Saguru gives him the information
          anyways, ending the conversation with, "Do your best at least. I don't want to see you lose to anyone
          before I capture you myself". Whether or not that was his actual motive, or if he was merely concerned
          for
          Kaito's well being, is unknown.

            </div>
          </div>
          In the manga, Kid and Conan are rivals. Ever since Kaito met Conan, Kaito always seems to be anticipating
          Conan's appearance at his heists. Conan makes the heists more interesting for Kaito, while Conan views
          Kaito's heists as entertainment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before being shrunk, Shinichi had encountered Kaitou Kid once during the Clock Tower heist, though they
            did not meet face-to-face. In their next encounter, however, after Shinichi had become Conan, Kid
            disguised himself as Ran to steal the Suzuki Black Star pearl. When Conan cornered him on the Suzuki
            cruise ship, Kid suggested that he'd stolen all of Ran's clothes to impersonate her, and left her naked on
            the deck. While this ended up being a bluff, Conan was shocked and infuriated. In subsequent encounters
            between Kid and Conan, Conan displays a much more intense desire to capture Kid.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since then, Conan is usually a serious threat to Kid's plans and stops Kid often enough from escaping with
            the jewel that Conan has gained a reputation in the press as Kid's "natural enemy". In several instances
            Conan appears to be able to 'sense' Kid's presence; knowing Kid is close by often causes Conan to behave
            far more frenetically. Appropriately, Kid seems to find Conan dangerous enough to warrant specific
            measures to keep the boy distracted. Conan does not seem to like Kid, saying once "He's only a thief that
            uses magic". However, if necessary, the two can put their rivalry aside (for a little while) and work
            together. Conan has something of a gentleman's agreement with Kaitou Kid that he won't look for the
            thief outside of heists. In several instances, beginning with the "Big Adventure in the Eccentric
            Residence" case, when Kid does Conan/Shinichi a favor, such as saving Genta's life in the aforementioned
            case, Conan reciprocates by halting his investigation just shy of capturing Kid, thereby allowing him to
            escape mostly unhindered. This exchange of favors can sometimes become a bit unbalanced; Conan was
            perfectly willing to force Kaitou Kid against his will into facing a member of the Black Organization at
            gunpoint in a carriage filled with explosives.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the movies, Kid becomes aware that Conan is Shinichi after he once overheard Conan talking to Professor
            Agasa and displaying too much criminal knowledge for a 7-year-old. As a result, he ends up using
            Shinichi's identity to either further his own goals and challenge Conan at the same time, or to pay back a
            favor Conan has done him. Since movies cannot be considered canon, it was once unclear whether Kid knows
            Conan is Shinichi in the official manga. However, since "Kaitou Kid and the Trick Box" case, it is clear
            that Kid does not know Conan's true identity because he called him "Conan-kun" and not "Shinichi" while
            they were alone. There are also some speculations on Conan figuring out that Kid isn't just stealing
            randomly. At the end of the OVA 4: Conan, Kid, and the Crystal Mother, Conan had turned with a serious
            face when he remembered a phrase that Kid had said, "Next time, I'll help myself to the Jewel of Destiny."
            In movie 14, Conan asked for Kid to disguise himself as him for a while.
          </p>
          <p>
            In chapter 1018 of the manga Kid is shown thinking "What's this? Two high school detectives..." while the
            only high school detectives that appeared, in that case, were Heiji and Conan, making it very likely that
            Kid is aware of Conan's identity but nothing has been officially stated or confirmed.

          Ran has always been suspicious of Kaito Kid, assuming that Kaito is Kudo Shinichi in disguise, despite
          Kaito Kid disguised Shinichi on many occasions. Therefore, Kaito Kid tricked Ran by seducing her with his
          romantic charms to believe that he is Shinichi. However, Ran already knows that Kaito Kid is not Shinichi.
          In Detective Conan's The Lost Ship in the Sky, Kaito Kid pretends to be Shinichi to convince Ran not to
          turn him in. At the end of the film, Ran and Kid almost kiss, until she told him, "you are not Shinichi."
          Conan shows up after seeing what Kaito did to Ran and immediately got jealous. Conan asked Ran, "How do
          you know that Kaito Kid is not Shinichi?" Ran responded that Kaito Kid "did something that Shinichi does
          not do." That is when Kaito Kid has his hands on her butt.

          Kaito and Heiji Hattori have never canonically met, although Heiji faced up against the Kid in Movie 3,
          and interacted with a disguised Kaito during Movie 10. They were also involved in the same cases in OVA 6
          and Movie 14, but never directly interacted. Also in Movie 10, there is a scene that we see Saguru, but at
          the end, it turns out that was Kaito so he has met Heiji as Saguru. But Heiji didn't seem to notice it.

          </div>
          In Lupin III vs. Detective Conan: The Movie, while they never directly meet face-to-face with each other,
          Kaitou Kid and Lupin III had made their first encounter at the beginning of the film. Kaito Kuroba, while
          being in his citizen guise, was among the many people present to see the heists of Lupin, who was
          masquerading as Kaitou Kid, with a valuable diamond. Fujiko Mine claimed if Lupin was unable to save her,
          by stealing the Cherry Sapphire, she can always ask Kaitou Kid for help. By the end of the film where
          Lupin was in Japan, in contrary to how Conan had thought he had left, Lupin had tried to steal another
          valuable jewel only to find it already to be stolen and replaced by a small note left by Kaitou Kid; the
          act was most likely to return the favor for Lupin’s temporary identity theft, for using Kid’s identity,
          with the diamond heist. As Lupin was being chased, by Inspector Zenigata who didn’t believe Lupin didn’t
          steal the jewel, he had declared his rivalry with Kaitou Kid.
