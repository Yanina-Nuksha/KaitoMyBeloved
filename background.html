              Kaito is a complex character, because he tends to hide behind masks a lot. His personality as Kuroba
              Kaito
              is the most honest, though even then he tends to hide a lot of his true feelings behind his Poker Face.

            Kaito is a second-year student at Ekoda High School Class 2-B alongside his childhood friend Aoko
            Nakamori, the witch Akako Koizumi, and transfer student detective Saguru Hakuba. Kaito discovers his
            father's identity as the original Kaitou Kid after eight years following his death thanks to a secret room
            inside his house as well as talking with his father's attendant and friend, Konosuke Jii. Picking up where
            his father left off, Kaito takes up the mantle of Kaitou Kid in an effort to lure out his father's
            murderers by making Kid a world-famous thief once again.
            It isn't until the Blue Birthday heist that the murderers appear and reveal that they are searching for
            the doublet red-colored gem Pandora, said to shed tears of immortality during the passing of a particular
            comet. Upon realizing the organization's aim and that his father was killed for his refusal to aid them in
            retrieving Pandora, Kaito vows as Kaitou Kid to find the Pandora gem first and shatter it into pieces.
            Kaito's mother is aware that Kaito discovered Toichi's secret room and has taken up the mantle of Kaitou
            Kid.

          According to Saguru's analysis during his search for Kaitou Kid's identity, Kaito is 174 cm (5' 8.5") tall,
          weighs 58 kg (128 lbs), has an IQ of 400, and is blood type 'B'. Kaito as his normal self seems to be rather
          popular in school although he tends to get in trouble with the ladies, particularly Aoko, for flipping up
          their skirts or peeking on them in the locker room.

            Kuroba Kaito is a fun loving prankster with an almost ever present smile who has a perverted streak and
            loves performing his magic tricks for everyone. He generally enjoys any attention he receives and doesnt
            embarrass easily, at least not visibly, but poker face will occasionally slip anyway, depending on exactly
            how serious the situation is. He also enjoys flirting on occasion.

          <h2>Kaito as Kid</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>
            In both civilian and costumed life, Kaitou Kid is a compulsive magician who is drawn to any challenge just
            for the sheer thrill of overcoming all hazards in the end. Kid is infamous for having a rather
            overconfident (close to the point of arrogance) attitude, always preferring to create as big a bang as
            possible. He loves nothing more than leading the police in wild goose chases, letting them get within a
            hair's breadth of catching him, before exiting one way or another. Seemingly having a soft-spot for his
            fans, there has been more than one occasion when Kid has refused to show when the police tried to bar the
            general public from witnessing his act. Generally, when these instances occur, one of Kid's tricks rely,
            one way or another, on his ability to blend in with a crowd.
          </p>

            </div>
          </div>
          Kaitou Kid is also quite a charmer, seeming to always know just what to say to the ladies to leave them
          speechless. Kid hates to see others get hurt, and he never hesitates in leaping to rescue someone, whether
          physically or mentally. Despite his low reputation in some quarters, Kid does have a sense of honor, in as
          much as that he decides to leave the loot behind if it has no further purpose other than having challenged
          his trickster skills, doesn't contain Pandora, or when a more humane background stands behind their
          existence. These qualities are some of the reasons why he and Conan occasionally end up as allies in a
          common cause.
          </p>
          <p>
            For some as yet unexplained reason, Kaito suffers from a severe case of ichthyophobia (fear of fish).

          <p>
            Kaito looks like an average Japanese teen with messy dark hair and purple eyes, which is really the only
            outwardly odd thing about him. He's a bit short for 17 and has a sturdier build than Kudo Shinichi who he
            bears an uncanny resemblance too. Since he's a magician who's always carrying his magical supplies on his
            person, he tends to wear baggy clothes with long sleeves to accommodate this.

          <h2>Abilities</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>
            Kaito is first and foremost a magician. An aspiring stage magician with a talent with street magic. He’s
            very skilled at slight of hand and always has something up his sleeves, even though he can convince you he
            doesn’t. He’s also a skilled stage magician already as evidenced by his performances as Kid, but stage
            magic requires more time to set up and an assistant or two so he’s not going to be doing much of that at
            the facility. He has no real magical ability whatsoever. All of it is smoke and mirrors, but he is good at
            what he does.
          </p>
          <p>
            He’s also a master of disguise, he can disguise himself as practically anyone, male or female, young or
            old, even children though that requires a bit more illusion, and he has shown the ability to mimic
            anyone’s voice without the help of some sort of voice modification device. As part of this, he’s also a
            talented actor.
          </p>
          <p>
            As Kaitou Kid, one of his trademark is the Card Gun, an oddly shaped gun that shoots playing card, which
            he mainly uses to knock weapons out of people’s hands, cut ropes and other things. There are even cards
            that explode like flash grenades or that create smoke screens or sleeping gas. The other is his glider,
            his primary source of transportation when escaping his heists.
